### `tf.segment_max(data, segment_ids, name=None)` {#segment_max}

Computes the maximum along segments of a tensor.

Read [the section on Segmentation](../../api_docs/python/math_ops.md#segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \max_j(data_j)\\) where `max` is over `j` such
that `segment_ids[j] == i`.

##### Args:


*  <b>`data`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `uint16`, `half`.
*  <b>`segment_ids`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
    A 1-D tensor whose rank is equal to the rank of `data`'s
    first dimension.  Values should be sorted and can be repeated.
*  <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).

##### Returns:

  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `data`.
  Has same shape as data, except for dimension 0 which
  has size `k`, the number of segments.
